28. Reverse only vowels in a string  
29. Check if one string is a rotation of another  
30. Check if string is a pangram (contains all letters A-Z)

---

## 🔴 Level 4 – Advanced Algorithmic Problems
> Focus: sliding window, hashing, two-pointer, and substring logic.

31. Find the longest substring without repeating characters  
32. Find the longest substring with K unique characters

34. Find smallest window that contains all characters of another string  
35. Count number of substrings that are palindrome  
36. Find length of longest repeating substring  
37. Find longest common prefix among array of strings  
38. Implement string compression (e.g. “aaabb” → “a3b2”)  
39. Decode a run-length encoded string  
40. Count the number of occurrences of each word in a sentence  

---

## 🟣 Level 5 – Pattern & Custom Logic Problems
> Focus: string patterns, rearrangements, and transformations.

41. Reverse words in a sentence  
42. Remove duplicate words from a sentence  
43. Capitalize the first letter of each word  
44. Sort characters of a string alphabetically  
45. Sort words in a sentence by length  
46. Check if string contains only digits  
47. Check if string contains only alphabets  
48. Replace substring in a string (manual implementation)  
49. Implement your own `substring()` method  
50. Implement custom `split()` method without using `split()`  

---

## 🟠 Level 6 – Special / Interview-Focused Problems
> Commonly asked in FAANG and competitive exams.

51. Find all possible valid IP addresses from given string  
52. Find minimum number of deletions to make string palindrome  
53. Check if edit distance between two strings is 1  
54. Find smallest substring with all distinct characters  
55. Convert Roman numeral to integer  
56. Convert integer to Roman numeral  
57. Find longest common subsequence (LCS) of two strings  
58. Find edit distance (Levenshtein distance) between two strings  
59. Implement KMP pattern matching algorithm  
60. Implement Rabin-Karp pattern matching algorithm  

---

## 🧭 Bonus – Real Use & Utility Problems
> Focus: real-world string handling with logic.

61. Count occurrences of a word in a paragraph  
62. Remove HTML tags from a string  
63. Extract digits from a string and find their sum  
64. Replace every vowel with next alphabet  
65. Check if email ID is valid (basic validation)  
66. Convert string to title case  
67. Convert camelCase to snake_case  
68. Find longest word in a sentence  
69. Find frequency of each word (Map-based)  
70. Validate balanced parentheses in an expression  

---

### 📘 Notes
- Practice **manual implementations** (no built-in methods) to master string logic.  
- Learn to use **`StringBuilder`** and **`StringBuffer`** for performance-based problems.  
- These problems help in mastering **string manipulation**, **pattern logic**, and **interview preparation**.
