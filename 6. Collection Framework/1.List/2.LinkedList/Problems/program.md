# 🔗 Linked List DSA Problems

A complete list of **Linked List problems** for Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) practice, categorized by difficulty.

## 🟢 Level 1 – Basics (Singly Linked List Operations)
> Focus: Node creation, insertion, deletion, traversal.

1. Create a Linked List and print all elements  
2. Insert at beginning / end / specific position  
3. Delete from beginning / end / specific position  
4. Find the length of a Linked List  
5. Search for an element in a Linked List  
6. Reverse a Linked List (Iterative & Recursive)  
7. Find the middle element of a Linked List  
8. Find the nth node from the end of the list  
9. Count occurrences of a given element  
10. Check if the Linked List is empty

## 🟡 Level 2 – Intermediate (Classic Patterns)
> Focus: Two-pointer technique, recursion, and slow-fast pointers.

11. Detect a loop in a Linked List (Floyd’s Cycle Detection)  
12. Find the starting point of a loop  
13. Remove the loop in a Linked List  
14. Check if a Linked List is palindrome  
15. Remove duplicates from a sorted Linked List  
16. Remove duplicates from an unsorted Linked List  
17. Merge two sorted Linked Lists  
18. Find the intersection point of two Linked Lists  
19. Find the length of a loop in Linked List  
20. Split a Linked List into two halves

## 🔵 Level 3 – Advanced (Hard / Interview-Level)
> Focus: Merging, rearranging, partitioning, flattening.

21. Rotate Linked List by k nodes  
22. Reverse nodes in groups of k (k-Reverse)  
23. Sort a Linked List (Merge Sort)  
24. Add two numbers represented by Linked Lists  
25. Subtract two numbers represented by Linked Lists  
26. Delete nodes which have greater value on right side  
27. Flatten a multilevel Linked List  
28. Clone a Linked List with random pointers  
29. Reorder Linked List (1 → N → 2 → N-1 …)  
30. Partition a Linked List around a value x

## 🔴 Level 4 – Doubly & Circular Linked Lists
> Focus: Bidirectional traversal and circular references.

31. Implement a Doubly Linked List  
32. Insert and Delete in Doubly Linked List  
33. Reverse a Doubly Linked List  
34. Convert Binary Tree to Doubly Linked List  
35. Implement Circular Linked List  
36. Detect loop in Circular Linked List  
37. Split a Circular Linked List into two halves  
38. Sorted insert in Circular Linked List

## 🟣 Level 5 – Miscellaneous / Complex
> These combine multiple ideas and are often asked in top tech interviews.

39. Merge k sorted Linked Lists (using Min-Heap)  
40. Remove every k-th node from Linked List  
41. Segregate even and odd nodes in Linked List  
42. Add 1 to a number represented by a Linked List  
43. Multiply two numbers represented by Linked Lists  
44. Check if two Linked Lists are identical  
45. Intersection of two sorted Linked Lists  
46. Delete alternate nodes  
47. Swap nodes in pairs  
48. Pairwise swap nodes without changing data  
49. Detect intersection (Y-shaped Linked Lists)  
50. LRU Cache implementation using Linked List + HashMap

### 🧭 Notes
- Start from Level 1 and move upward as you gain confidence.  
- Implement both **iterative and recursive** versions where possible.  
- These problems are highly common in interviews (Amazon, Google, Microsoft, etc.).
